  When I am not working or doing research, I enjoy taking photographs. I got
  my first DSLR back in 2010 and started learning photography autodidactically.
  Then in 2012, I took a film photography course at the Antigua Academia
 de San Carlos in Mexico City-the oldest fine arts school in the American continent-
 where I learned how to handle a medium format camera, develop and print my own work,
 and where I fell in love with film photography. A year later, in 2013, I got my trusty
 Pentax K1000 by accidentally winnin a bid on eBay, the camera I still use to this day.
 These days though, I alternate between taking pcitures with my iPhone and my old Pentax K1000.
 Ten years after I first picked up a "serious" camera, I still consider myself an amateur,
 but I am working on developing my own voice and style, and hopefully on having a dark
 room of my own one day!
